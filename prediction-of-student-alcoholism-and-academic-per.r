The predominant issue linked to alcohol consumption during adolescence lies in its adverse effects on students' school performance, often resulting in an elevated risk of school failure and increased school absences.\n\nThe discourse surrounding alcohol consumption during adolescence has become a subject of debate, particularly in developed countries, with implications for public health, as well as social and cultural dynamics. Recent studies conducted in Portugal over the past five years, such as the one led by [Silvetra et al](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348944503_Risk_factors_of_alcohol_consumption_among_portuguese_adolescents_and_young_adults_data_from_the_Global-School_Based_Student_Health_Survey), underscore a high prevalence of alcohol consumption among Portuguese school adolescents. Notably, binge drinking levels are reported to be comparable to those observed in the United States. Paulo Silvestre et al. revealed that a significant number of participants reported initiating alcohol consumption under the influence of friends and using it as a means of socializing, while some resorted to alcohol as a coping mechanism for life's challenges.\n\nIn a parallel vein, research in the United States, as articulated in [Teenage Alcohol Use and Educational Attainment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2583376/#B82), explores the correlation between teenage alcohol use and school failure, raising questions about whether this relationship is causal or spurious. Human capital models predict a direct negative impact of teenage alcohol use on educational attainment. Heavy alcohol use, in particular, is implicated in diverting time away from studying, completing homework, and seeking academic assistance. Beyond these immediate effects, heavy alcohol use during adolescence may compromise long-term educational attainment by influencing brain structure, functioning, and neuropsychological performance. Moreover, heavy alcohol use heightens the risk of motor vehicle accidents, physical and mental health problems, and violence, thereby impacting intervening variables that contribute to reduced educational attainment.\n\nThe dataset available for my study offers a unique opportunity to scrutinize the intricate relationships between student backgrounds, alcoholism, and academic achievements. This investigation is pivotal for comprehending the multifaceted dynamics of alcohol consumption among adolescents and its far-reaching implications for their educational journeys.\n\n**According to some problems with installing R packages in Kaggle, I upload my work into RPubs.
