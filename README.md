# Student Alcoholism and Academic Performance Prediction

This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive study on predicting student alcoholism and academic performance using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a diverse dataset of student attributes, including demographic information, study habits, and alcohol consumption patterns, we develop predictive models to forecast both academic outcomes and alcohol usage among students.

## Key Features

- üìä **Comprehensive Dataset**: The study utilizes a rich dataset encompassing various student attributes such as age, gender, family background, study habits, and alcohol consumption levels.

- üîç **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We perform in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights within the dataset, providing a solid foundation for predictive modeling.

- üî¢ **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes meticulous preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and applying dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

- üå≥ **Random Forest Regression**: We employ the powerful Random Forest Regression algorithm to build predictive models for student alcohol consumption levels and academic performance. The models are optimized using grid search cross-validation to ensure robust and accurate predictions.

- üéØ **Feature Importance Analysis**: We conduct feature importance analysis to identify the most influential predictors of student alcoholism and academic success. This analysis provides valuable insights into the key factors driving these outcomes.

- üìà **Model Evaluation**: The predictive models are rigorously evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) to assess their effectiveness and reliability.

- üí° **Actionable Insights**: The study offers actionable insights and recommendations based on the findings, empowering educational institutions, policymakers, and healthcare professionals to develop targeted interventions and support strategies for students.
